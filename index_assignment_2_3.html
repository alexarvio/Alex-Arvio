        <h1>Childhood and Teenage Years</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Alex. I am a 21 year old male who was born in Spain. I have a double nationality, Spanish and Finish. Even though I speak both languages, I consider myself more Spanish because I have lived there 19 years. I moved to Amsterdam in August 2020 to begin my career as an IT student and I am planning to stay at least 4 years in the Netherlands.

            I was born in Barcelona, Spain. I spent my childhood and teenager years there. I attended elementary and primary school in a Spanish school and Highschool in an American International school.

        <h2>Travelling</h2>
        <p>
            In 2018 I visited London with a friend. We went to an Eminem concert in the Twickenham stadium. I bought some merchandise which cost me around 40&#163.

            In February 2020 I went with my mom to New York for the first time. One of the highlights was visiting Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Center. The tour was about 25&#36 per person.

        I went to Paris back in 2016 with my Dad and I remember that at the top of the Eiffel Tower he ordered a glass of champagne which was 15&#8364!
