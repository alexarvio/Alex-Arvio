<h1>About me</h1>
    <body>
        My name is Alex. I am a 21 year old male who was born in Spain. I have a double nationality, Spanish and Finish. Even though I speak both languages, I consider myself more Spanish because I have lived there 19 years. I moved to Amsterdam in August 2020 to begin my career as an IT student and I am planning to stay at least 4 years in the Netherlands.
